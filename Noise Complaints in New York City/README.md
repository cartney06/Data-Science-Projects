# *__Noise Complaints in New York City__*

## Project Description
An exploratory data analysis of noise complaints in New York City. Answers such questions as when and where do noise complaints occur most often. This was a part of a project I completed as part of Data Science program at Syracuse.

The questions this report answers are the following:

- Are noise complaints likely to occur at times throughout the day/month/year? This question will be answered by the percentage of noise complaints by month, day, and hour of the day.
- Are noise complaints more likely to come from specific areas of the city? We will answer this question based upon the percentage of noise complaints by borough.
- What are the characteristics of where the most (top 10) noise complaints occur? For this question, we will address by counting the number of noise complaints per capita by census tract and pull census characteristics (income, ethnicity, and population).
