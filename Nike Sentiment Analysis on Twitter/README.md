# **Nike Sentiment Analysis on Twitter**
***Analyzing the Kaepernick Campaign from Summer 2018***

## Project Description
In this project, I examine Nike’s brand sentiment on Twitter prior to the launch of the Nike Kaepernick campaign and after the launch of the Kaepernick campaign and compare Nike’s brand sentiment after the campaign. I also explore key topics that were part of the discussion about Nike during these two time periods.
