# **Exploring Restaurant Sanitation Grades**

## Project Description and Overview
An analysis of restaurant sanitation grades in New York City and determining which classification algorithm predicts the sanitation grade most accurately.

This project was completed as part of a capstone project for my Data Mining class as part of my Masters in Data Science program. The scope of the project was limited to performing the analysis in R and selecting three data mining algorithms studied as part of the class. The algorithms selected were Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines.
