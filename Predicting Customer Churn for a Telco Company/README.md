# **Predicting Churn for a Telco Company**

## Project Description
This particular project was for a course I took in Marketing Analytics as part of an elective for my graduate program in data science. I decided to use this particular Telco data set as it is similar in characteristics of what an actual real telco company would capture on its customer base. 

The goals of this project was to:
- Understand the characteristics of the Telco company's customer base
- Accurately predict whether a customer will churn or not based upon their profile using regression techniques only
- Understand which customer attributes are likely to lead to customer churn

## Tools
Python 3
 - Pandas
 - Numpy
 - Matplotlib
 - Seaborn
