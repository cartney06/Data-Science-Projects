# Data Science Portfolio Projects
This is a repository of personal projects I have worked on over the years. These projects were completed by me for self-learning, academic, and just for plain old fun. Below you will find the name followed by a short description about each project. 

Within each project's folder you will find the following:
* Description of each project in markdown
* Jupyter (iPython) notebook or R markdown file containing in-depth analysis
* Python packages and scripts for executing the analysis/program

Feel free to look around and reach out to me if you have any questions or find something interesting/useful! 

For a more in depth experience about each project and my background, check out [cartneythompson.com](http://cartneythompson.com)

*Please note data and analysis made available in this repository is for demonstration purposes only.*
