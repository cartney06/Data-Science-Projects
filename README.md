# Data Science Portfolio Projects
This is a repository of personal projects I have worked on over the years. These projects were completed by me for self-learning, academic, and just for plain old fun. Below you will find the name followed by a short description about each project. 

Within each project's folder you will find the following:
* Description of each project in markdown
* Jupyter (iPython) notebook or R markdown file containing in-depth analysis
* Python packages and scripts for executing the analysis/program

Feel free to look around and reach out to me if you have any questions or find something interesting/useful! 

For a more in depth experience about each project and my background, check out [cartneythompson.com](http://cartneythompson.com)

### [Predicting Customer Churn for a Telco Company](https://github.com/cartney06/Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/Predicting%20Customer%20Churn%20for%20a%20Telco%20Company)
This particular project was for a course I took in Marketing Analytics as part of an elective for my graduate program in data science. 
I decided to use this particular Telco data set as it is similar in characteristics of what an actual real telco company would capture on its customer base.
The goals of this project was to:

- Understand the characteristics of the Telco company's customer base
- Accurately predict whether a customer will churn or not based upon their profile using regression techniques only
- Understand which customer attributes are likely to lead to customer churn

### [Exploring Restaurant Sanitation Grades](https://github.com/cartney06/Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/Exploring%20Restaurant%20Sanitation%20Grades)
An analysis of restaurant sanitation grades in New York City and determining which classification algorithm predicts the sanitation grade most accurately.
Algorithms explored for this project; Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines.
